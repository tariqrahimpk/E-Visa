          <p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan has launched e-Visa portal to facilitate visa issuance process for genuine travellers.</p>
          <p>Electronic visa application does not require more information than traditional paper application and it grants the same right to enter Kyrgyzstan territory as ordinary sticker-visa in the passport.</p>
          <p>Applying for a visa through this portal has lots of advantages. No need to make an appointment or present original documents to the Embassy or Consular Office.</p>
          <p>All you need is internet connection, credit or debit card for making payment and scanned copies of your documents.</p>
          <p>You can check if you are eligible for e-Visa by going Home Page Get information Do I need visa? and selecting your country/region of travel document. Each traveler must obtain a separate e-Visa, including infants and children (even if children/infants are included in their parentsâ€™ passports).</p>
